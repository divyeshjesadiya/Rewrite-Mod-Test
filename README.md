# Rewrite-Mod-Test

This script allows to know if the Rewrite Mod is properly installed for pH7CMS. Sometime, you have just to change/add the [directory of "RewriteBase" in the root .htaccess file](https://github.com/pH7Software/pH7-Social-Dating-CMS/blob/master/.htaccess#L15-L19) in order to make **[pH7CMS](https://github.com/pH7Software/pH7-Social-Dating-CMS)** working properly.
